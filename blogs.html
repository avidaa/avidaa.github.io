                An experiment is reproducible when subsequent experiments, by the same or different scientists, confirm the results. 
                The terms repeatability and replicability are sometimes used interchangeably or with related meanings, 
                but we will use reproducibility as an all-encompassing term. Reproducibility can occur at several levels.
